- GI: mean 5.2 days (3.8, 6.8) for Singapore and lower 4.0 (3.0, 4.9) for Tianjin. [Ganyani\_2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201952/)

- Metanalysis: 5.4 days (5.19, 5.61) [Rai\_2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7448781/)


## Alpha
Earliest documented samples: UK, Sep 2020

- GT: mean 5.5 (4.7-6.5) [Hart\_2022](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/)
- SD of 3.3?

## Beta
Earliest documented samples: SA, May 2020

## Gamma
Earliest documented samples: BR, Nov 2020

## Delta
Earliest documented samples: IN, Oct 2020

- SI mean 3.72 (3.62, 3.80) [UKHSA](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1056487/Technical-Briefing-36-22.02.22.pdf)
- GT: mean 4.7 (4.1-5.6) [Hart\_2022](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/)
- SD of 2.2?

## Omicron
Earliest documented samples: multiple, Nov 2021

- SI: mean 3.27 (3.09, 3.46) [UKHSA](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1056487/Technical-Briefing-36-22.02.22.pdf)
- 3.5/3 between and within household [Backer\_2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8832521/#:~:text=The%20reported%20values%20of%20the,Korea%20%5B10%2C11%5D.)
- Above also links to a 2.2 and 2.8 estimates in SK ([Kim\_2021]() and [Lee\_2021]() ), 2.75 estimates in Belgium ([Kremer 2022]())
Seems very short to me, especially because Belgium paper estimates 3.00 for Delta.


## Extra:

- Serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 was shortened over time by non-pharmaceutical interventions.[Ali\_2020]()
